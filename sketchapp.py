# A normal image consists of 3 layers Red,Blue,Green and thus forms a 3 dimensional matrix, whereas gray scale image is a 2 dimensional matrix.
# We compress the image to grayscale
    grayimg = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# blurring the image
# It blurs the gray scale image obtained through the above operation. It is useful for removing noise. 
# It actually removes high frequency content (eg: noise, edges) from the image.
# We simply reduce the edge content and makes the transition form one color to the other very smooth.

    blurimg = cv2.GaussianBlur(grayimg, (3, 3), 0)

# extracting edges
# First argument is our input image. Second and third arguments are our minVal and maxVal respectively.

# applying threshold
    # :Gray scale image is converted into Binary Image, it uses a threshold.
    # Thresholding is a process of converting image to binary form.In OpenCV thresholding is done on grayscale images, which have pixel values ranging from 0â€“255.
    # Suppose gray scale values are from 0 (Pure Black) to 255(Pure White), 
    # values greater than threshold will be converted into 1 (White) and below to threshold will be converted into 0 (Black).
